## The Unsolved Files: Unearthing Forgotten Stories with Artificial Intelligence

The Unsolved Files is an innovative web application that uses artificial intelligence to bring unsolved crime news to life. Through a combination of technologies such as News API, Midjourney, Gemini, and D-Id, the application gathers news about murders and disappearances from the previous month, generates realistic avatars of the people involved, creates detailed narratives about their lives, and presents these stories in video format.

**Key Features:**

-   **Selected News:** Gathers the 30 most relevant news stories about unsolved crimes from the previous month.
-   **AI-Generated Avatars:** Uses Midjourney to create realistic avatars based on descriptions of the people involved in the crimes.
-   **AI-Generated Stories:** Employs Gemini to generate detailed and coherent narratives about the lives of the victims and suspects.
-   **Videos with Avatars and Voices:** Combines the avatars generated by Midjourney with the stories generated by Gemini and uses D-Id to create videos with synthetic voices narrating the stories.
-   **Intuitive Interface:** Presents the news and videos clearly and organized, allowing users to easily explore the cases.

**Technologies Used:**

-   **Frontend:** React, Next.js
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
-   **APIs:** News API, Midjourney API, Gemini API, D-Id API
-   **Database:** SQLite

**Objective:**

The goal of The Unsolved Files is to shed light on forgotten cases and generate interest in solving unsolved crimes. By combining news gathering with content generation through artificial intelligence, the application offers a unique and immersive experience that allows users to connect with the stories in a deeper way.

**Ethical Considerations:**

The Unsolved Files project is aware of the sensitivity of the subject and is committed to handling information with respect and responsibility. Measures will be taken to ensure the privacy of the people involved in the cases and to avoid the dissemination of false or misleading information.
